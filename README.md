## Installing

### Prerequisites

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### macOS
Download the latest  [Haska release](https://haska.io/download).    

If you want to install this repository in your computer as contributor you can follow the below instruction :

    git clone https://github.com/hasska/client.git   
Install packages :

    npm install
Build for release or dev by :

    npm run build
    
Running electron application:

    npm run electron

## Building
Weâ€™ll be using [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) for building our application for release version  of every operations systems. Currently Haska only support mac OSX and as contributor you can work on the other operation services build.

for use in npm scripts

    npm install electron-packager --save-dev

for use from cli

    npm install electron-packager -g

then run below in cmd:
```
electron-packager <sourcedir> <appname> --platform=<platform> --arch=<arch> [optional flags...]
```
This will:

-   Find or download the correct release of Electron
-   Use that version of Electron to create a app in  `<out>/<appname>-<platform>-<arch>`  _(this can be customized via an optional flag)_

`--platform`  and  `--arch`  can be omitted, in two cases:

-   If you specify  `--all`  instead, bundles for all valid combinations of target platforms/architectures will be created.
-   Otherwise, a single bundle for the host platform/architecture will be created.

For an overview of the other optional flags, run  `electron-packager --help`  or see  [usage.txt](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/blob/master/usage.txt). For detailed descriptions, see the  [API documentation](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/blob/master/docs/api.md).

If  `appname`  is omitted, this will use the name specified by "productName" or "name" in the nearest package.json.

**Characters in the Electron app name which are not allowed in all target platforms' filenames (e.g.,  `/`), will be replaced by hyphens (`-`).**
