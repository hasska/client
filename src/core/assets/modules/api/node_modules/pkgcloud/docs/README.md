## pkgcloud documentation

pkgcloud is a multi-provider cloud provisioning library for node.js that abstracts away differences among multiple cloud providers.

### Unified Vocabulary

Due to the differences between the vocabulary for each service provider, **[pkgcloud uses its own unified vocabulary](vocabulary.md).**

**Note:** Unified vocabularies may not yet be defined for *beta* services.

### Supported Providers

Supporting every API for every cloud service provider in Node.js is a huge undertaking, but _that is the long-term goal of `pkgcloud`_. **Special attention has been made to ensure that each service type has enough providers for a critical mass of portability between providers** (i.e. Each service implemented has multiple providers).

If a service does not have at least two providers, it is considered a *beta* interface; We reserve the right to improve the API as multiple providers will allow generalization to be better determined.
