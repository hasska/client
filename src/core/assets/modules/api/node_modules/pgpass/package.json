  "readme": "# pgpass\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hoegaarden/pgpass.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hoegaarden/pgpass)\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install pgpass\n```\n\n## Usage\n```js\nvar pgPass = require('pgpass');\n\nvar connInfo = {\n  'host' : 'pgserver' ,\n  'user' : 'the_user_name' ,\n};\n\npgPass(connInfo, function(pass){\n  conn_info.password = pass;\n  // connect to postgresql server\n});\n```\n\n## Description\n\nThis module tries to read the `~/.pgpass` file (or the equivalent for windows systems). If the environment variable `PGPASSFILE` is set, this file is used instead. If everything goes right, the password from said file is passed to the callback; if the password cannot be read `undefined` is passed to the callback.\n\nCases where `undefined` is returned:\n\n- the environment variable `PGPASSWORD` is set\n- the file cannot be read (wrong permissions, no such file, ...)\n- for non windows systems: the file is write-/readable by the group or by other users\n- there is no matching line for the given connection info\n\nThere should be no need to use this module directly; it is already included in `node-postgresq`.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe module reads the environment variable `PGPASS_NO_DEESCAPE` to decide if the the read tokens from the password file should be de-escaped or not. Default is to do de-escaping. For further information on this see [this commit](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/8d15e3ec4fcb735875a8a70a09ec0c62153c3329).\n\n\n## Tests\n\nThere are tests in `./test/`; including linting and coverage testing. Running `npm test` runs:\n\n- `jshint`\n- `mocha` tests\n- `jscoverage` and `mocha -R html-cov`\n\nYou can see the coverage report in `coverage.html`.\n\n\n## Development, Patches, Bugs, ...\n\nIf you find Bugs or have improvments, please feel free to open a issue on github. If you provide a pull request, I'm more than happy to merge them, just make sure to add tests for your changes.\n\n## Links\n\n- https://github.com/hoegaarden/node-pgpass\n- http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgpass.html\n- https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Pgpass\n- https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/interfaces/libpq/fe-connect.c\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-2016 Hannes Hörl\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
