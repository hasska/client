For example, `X-Powered-By: Express` is sent in every HTTP request coming from Express, by default. This won't provide much security benefit ([as discussed here](https://github.com/strongloop/express/pull/2813#issuecomment-159270428)), but might help a tiny bit. It will also improve performance by reducing the number of bytes sent.\n\n```javascript\nvar hidePoweredBy = require('hide-powered-by')\napp.use(hidePoweredBy())\n```\n\nYou can also explicitly set the header to something else, if you want. This could throw people off:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(hidePoweredBy({ setTo: 'PHP 4.2.0' }))\n```\n\nNote: if you're using Express, you don't need this middleware and can just do this:\n\n```javascript\napp.disable('x-powered-by')\n```\n",
